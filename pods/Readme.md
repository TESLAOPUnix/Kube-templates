## Here I will be explaining the pods file 
- Nginx.yaml => you may change the name of the pod but remember image should remain what is available in dockerhub, I have kept it latest but if you need to use a version use :
  If you want to use some other image or just want the basic syntax of it remeber to change the port or remove it as per the image you use.
